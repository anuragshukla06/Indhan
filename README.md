  * Average Mileage of other vehicles with same model and year of purchase
* A fuel station reviewing system called “Indhan Rating” has been fashioned eyeing warily the needs of its user, in which each fuel station is rated just by a few taps on the screen, based on the following metrics:
  * If washroom, food, cashless payments and air filling facilities are available or not
  * Sanitation, Ease of payments and food outlets (if available)
  * Reporting fraud
* Fuel tank is monitored continuously, so as to detect any leakage or fraudulent refilling at petrol pumps
* Given the to and from locations of a journey, it gives the amount of petrol to be refilled alongside the cost incurred, based on the current fuel levels considering the not-so-much-thought-about factors such as traffic, steepness of road and speed limit constraints.
* On low fuel levels it’ll prompt the user, directions to the nearest fuel station. User can also choose the nearest petrol pump of his liking based on Indhan Rating and/or facilities provided such as food, cashless payments and washrooms.
* SOS system automatically sends distress signals in case of an accident or on user’s command, to registered mobile phones.
* A machine learning algorithm predicts future mileage of the vehicle, to help user decide what’s the best time to sell his vehicle
